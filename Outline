== YAML - The Bad, the Good and the Ingy

== YAML - The Bad

* Started in April 2001 (over 8 years ago)
* Many Incompatible Implementations
* Very complex specification
* 1.2 specification is not released
* No implementation (not even libyaml) fully matches the spec
* Terrible vim syntax highlighting

== YAML - The Good

* Fairly Ubiquitous - Everybody's using it
* Acmeism - Works for all modern prgramming languages
* Simple for simple stuff
* Deep for hard stuff
* New O'Reilly book and OSCON talk!

== YAML - The Ingy

* Ingy is one of the 3 authors of YAML
* Ingy is the only Perl person of the 3
* Everyone assumes Ingy will do everything YAML related
* Ingy is not the best Perl programmer
* But he's getting better
